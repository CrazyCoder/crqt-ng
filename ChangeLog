      Main changes:
    Multi-tabbed interface implemented.

    See below for changes.

2023-02-06  Aleksey Chernov  <valexlin@gmail.com>

    Update src/desktop/crqt.appdata.xml

    Update README.md: added info about new featutes: Markdown format support, Multi-tabbed interface, flatpak package.

    CR3View: when loading a document or applying options, an argument has been added that allows not checking font compatibility.
    This will eliminate many font incompatibility messages when there are multiple open tabs.

2023-02-05  Aleksey Chernov  <valexlin@gmail.com>

    Optimization and fixes in the implementation of the multi-tabbed interface:
    * added 'active' property for tabs, i.e. whether the tab is currently active;
    * for inactive tabs, file loading and window resizing actions are not processed,
      but saved to the list of scheduled actions;
    * thus, when loading a saved session, documents for all tabs are not loaded immediately;
    * when processing scheduled actions, they are first sorted so that the resizing of the document
      is performed first and only after that the document is loaded, this avoids redundant rendering
      of the document when loading the session in the presence of the document cache - 1st time when
      opening document with default size, 2nd time when resizing;
    * information about the active tab has been added to the session data.

    When specifying a real font when forming a css style fragment, the font name is enclosed in quotation marks.

2023-01-27  Aleksey Chernov  <valexlin@gmail.com>

    Implemented portable settings mode.
    This mode is enabled if a 'portable.mark' file is found in the application directory (the directory that contains the application executable).

    Intended mostly for portable Win32 applications.
